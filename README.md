# Air-Pollution-Prediction

####
The Beijing PM2.5 Data Data Set is a comprehensive collection of air pollution data specifically focused on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller) levels in Beijing, China. PM2.5 is considered a major air pollutant and has significant impacts on human health and the environment.

In this first we will perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. After processing and visualisation we will move towards model implementation which will be done by sklearn library. After model implementation we will evaluate the models and see their performance and we will check that any model is overfitted.If any model is overfitted then we will apply cross validation or hyperparameter tuning to increase it's performance.
